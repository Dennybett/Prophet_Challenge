### Forecasting net

#### Project description

In this project, we analyse Mercado Libre a popular e-commerce site in Latin America with the goal of growing it.
This project analyzes the company's financial data and its users data to predict search traffic which can translate into the ability to successfully trade its stock.

More specifically, this project finds patterns in the company's google search traffic to the hour, looks for trends in the search traffic data based on the seasons, relates the search traffic to stock prices and creates a time series model using Prophet.

This project was made in Google colab and can be run using jupyter supported platforms like VS Code.
